Keypuk NìNa’vi
==============
A Greasemonkey Userscript to alter Facebook to display words in Na'vi.
(New: And Dothraki! See below.)

There is a [Discussion and community page](http://forum.learnnavi.org/navify-the-web/keypuk-ninavi-%28navi-facebook-project%29) on the LearnNavi.org forums.

The code is from [Secwepemc Facebook](https://github.com/neskie/secwepemc-facebook) written by Manuel Neski, and the Na'vi translations are our own. Secwepemc Facebook is no longer updated, as sadly Manuel has passed away. We are extremely grateful for his work.

Requirements
------------
You will need a browser capable of running Greasemonkey Userscripts.
This includes:

* [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com) ([with an addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748))
* [Google Chrome](http://chrome.google.com)
* [Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/) ([with an addon](http://www.bhelpuri.net/Trixie/))
* [Safari](http://apple.com/safari) ([with an addon](http://8-p.info/greasekit/))

Installation
------------

1. Make sure you have a Greasemonkey capable browser (see above)
2. Click [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/keypuk-ninavi/raw/master/keypuk-ninavi.user.js) to install the script.
3. Navigate to Facebook and you should see some of the text has been translated.
4. (optional albeit recommended) [Learn the language!](http://learnnavi.org)

But not everything is translated!
-----------------------------
This script is a work in progress, and is continually updated. Many words are currently not translatable and many more have not yet been identified as translatable.

Think you can help?
-------------------
If you think you can help translate, see the [discussion thread](http://forum.learnnavi.org/navify-the-web/keypuk-ninavi-%28navi-facebook-project%29) on the LearnNavi.org forums or fork this repo, translate some, and send a pull request!

There is also a [to do list](https://github.com/RichardLitt/keypuk-ninavi/blob/master/todo.md) on GitHub.

But... I speak Dothraki!
------------------------

We're just starting with that, too! Great, glad you made it here.

Here is the [discussion thread](http://forum.dothraki.org/general-discussion/dothraki-facebook/).
The code is the same, just in a different file with Dothraki
translations.

Click [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/keypuk-ninavi/raw/master/dothraki.user.js) to install.
