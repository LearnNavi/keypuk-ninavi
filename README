Keypuk NÃ¬Na'vi

A Greasemonkey Userscript to alter Facebook to display words
in Na'vi.

Discussion and community page:http://forum.learnnavi.org/navify-the-web/keypuk-ninavi-(navi-facebook-project)/?topicseen

The code is from Secwepemc Facebook. The translations are our own, as well as any modifications. The original github is here:https://github.com/neskie/secwepemc-facebook, but is no longer updated, as has sadly Manuel Neski passed away. We are extremely greatful for his work. 

Greasemonkey scripts allow you to alter web pages in many different ways.  We are altering the website so that words in Facebook are in Na'vi

This is a work in progress. Many words will are not currently translateable. There are also many words which have not yet been identified as translatable. The current tasks available are to:

* Identify words that can be translated, and translate them.
* Fix poor translations.
* Work to better replace texts to include images which are lost.
* Work to scrape parts of the page which are not translateable yet.
* Fix faulty replacements which break the forms.

This is a workaround to the official Facebook "Translations App":http://www.facebook.com/translations/, as Na'vi is not listed and has not been for two years.
